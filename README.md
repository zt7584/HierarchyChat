# HierarchyChat

## Description

In order to be familiar with Android and Firebase, I decided to build this hierarchy chatting application. Users can
chat in a hierarchy of groups, and I am trying to add creative chatting medium instead of plain text, image, or video.

## Current Functionality

1. User can register and login in the same screen.
2. User can create group under another group.
3. User can make request to enter group created by others.
4. User can accept/decline request from other users.
5. User can send out a paint board as part of a message, and every user in the group can draw on it at the same time.

## Future Tasks

1. Separate register and login into two screens.
2. Utilize Firebase Authentication(Using Custom/Facebook/Twitter/Github Account) instead of mananging user by myself.
3. Show realtime update, including new messages, request, etc.
4. Enrich paint board with allowing user to use different color, each user has different color.
5. Freeze the paint board after a limited amount of time.
6. Implement some simple game modules as part of a message, so that user can play directly on chat screen.
